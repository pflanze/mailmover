- broken auto-responders sending replies to list mail: need to be
  delayed to give the own mail chance to arrive and be registered, so
  that auto-responses can be correlated with them (and if so, filtered
  away (in Z.junk.list-auto-replies or so?), if not, then one
  should see them in the inbox or something else that's closer)

  - will greylisting be enough?

  - otherwise, keep in 'auto-response' new, check this folder
    periodically, too, mails still in new and older than 10 minutes or
    so, re-filter
