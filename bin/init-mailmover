    Maildir/new), and drops them to the right place within the maildir
    \$to-Maildir. Logs are written to \$logdir in daemontools multilog
    format (you could use the tai and taif scripts from chj-bin to
    read them).

    Options can be any mailmover options; particularly interesting is:

       --ham  assume any mail in from-dir is a ham (e.g. in ham
              teaching mode)

    Note that mailmover is being restarted about every 5 minutes
    anyway. But the restart action will still be useful to pick up
    configuration changes immediately."
